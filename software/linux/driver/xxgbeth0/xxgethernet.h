*
* The Xilinx XGEMAC Ethernet MAC driver component. This driver supports hard
* Ethernet core for Virtex-6(TM) devices and soft Ethernet core for
* Virtex-6(TM) and other supported devices. The supported speed can be
* 10/100/1000 Mbps and can reach upto 2000/2500 Mbps (1000Base-X versions).
*
* For a full description of XGEMAC Ethernet features, please see the hardware
* spec.
* This driver supports the following features:
*   - Memory mapped access to host interface registers
*   - Virtual memory support
*   - Unicast, broadcast, and multicast receive address filtering
*   - Full and half duplex operation
*   - Automatic source address insertion or overwrite (programmable)
*   - Automatic PAD & FCS insertion and stripping (programmable)
*   - Flow control
*   - VLAN frame support
*   - Pause frame support
*   - Jumbo frame support
*   - Partial and full checksum offload
*   - Extended multicast addresses to 2**23.
*   - Extended VLAN translation, tagging and stripping supports.
*
* <h2>Driver Description</h2>
*
* The device driver enables higher layer software (e.g., an application) to
* configure a XGEMAC Ethernet device. It is intended that this driver be used in
* cooperation with another driver (FIFO or DMA) for data communication. This
* device driver can support multiple devices even when those devices have
* significantly different configurations.
*
* <h2>Initialization & Configuration</h2>
*
* The XXgEthernet_Config structure can be used by the driver to configure
* itself. This configuration structure is typically created by the tool-chain
* based on hardware build properties, although, other methods are allowed and
* currently used in some systems.
*
* To support multiple runtime loading and initialization strategies employed
* by various operating systems, the driver instance can be initialized using
* the XXgEthernet_CfgInitialze() routine.
*
* <h2>Interrupts and Asynchronous Callbacks</h2>
*
* The driver has no dependencies on the interrupt controller. It provides
* no interrupt handlers. The application/OS software should set up its own
* interrupt handlers if required.
*
* <h2>Device Reset</h2>
*
* When a XGEMAC Ethernet device is connected up to a FIFO or DMA core in hardware,
* errors may be reported on one of those cores (FIFO or DMA) such that it can
* be determined that the XGEMAC Ethernet device needs to be reset. If a reset is
* performed, the calling code should also reconfigure and reapply the proper
* settings in the XGEMAC Ethernet device.
*
* When a XGEMAC Ethernet device reset is required, XXgEthernet_Reset() should
* be utilized.
*
* <h2>Virtual Memory</h2>
*
* This driver may be used in systems with virtual memory support by passing
* the appropriate value for the <i>EffectiveAddress</i> parameter to the
* XXgEthernet_CfgInitialize() routine.
*
* <h2>Transfering Data</h2>
*
* The XGEMAC Ethernet core by itself is not capable of transmitting or receiving
* data in any meaningful way. Instead the XGEMAC Ethernet device need to be
* connected to a FIFO or DMA core in hardware.
*
* This XGEMAC Ethernet driver is modeled in a similar fashion where the
* application code or O/S adapter driver needs to make use of a separate FIFO
* or DMA driver in connection with this driver to establish meaningful
* communication over Ethernet.
*
* <h2>Checksum Offloading</h2>
*
* If configured, the device can compute a 16-bit checksum from frame data. In
* most circumstances this can lead to a substantial gain in throughput.
*
* The checksum offload settings for each frame sent or received are
* transmitted through the AXI4-Stream interface in hardware. What this means
* is that the checksum offload feature is indirectly controlled in the
* XGEMAC Ethernet device through the driver for DMA core connected
* to the XGEMAC Ethernet device.
*
* Refer to the documentation for DMA driver used for data
* communication on how to set the values for the relevant AXI4-Stream control
* words.
*
* Since this hardware implementation is general purpose in nature system
* software must perform pre and post frame processing to obtain the desired
* results for the types of packets being transferred. Most of the time this
* will be TCP/IP traffic.
*
* TCP/IP and UDP/IP frames contain separate checksums for the IP header and
* UDP/TCP header+data.
* For partial checksum offloading (enabled while configuring the hardware),
* the IP header checksum cannot be offloaded. Many stacks that support
* offloading will compute the IP header if required and use hardware to compute
* the UDP/TCP header+data checksum. There are other complications concerning
* the IP pseudo header that must be taken into consideration. Readers should
* consult a TCP/IP design reference for more details.
* For full checksum offloading (enabled while configuring the hardware), the
* IPv4 checksum calculation and validation can also be offloaded at the
* harwdare. More details on this will be updated when available.
*
* There are certain device options that will affect the checksum calculation
* performed by hardware for Tx:
*
*   - FCS insertion disabled (XXGE_FCS_INSERT_OPTION): software is required to
*     calculate and insert the FCS value at the end of the frame, but the
*     checksum must be known ahead of time prior to calculating the FCS.
*     Therefore checksum offloading cannot be used in this situation.
*
* And for Rx:
*
*   - FCS/PAD stripping disabled (XXGE_FCS_STRIP_OPTION): The 4 byte FCS at the
*     end of frame will be included in the hardware calculated checksum.
*     software must subtract out this data.
*
*   - FCS/PAD stripping disabled (XXGE_FCS_STRIP_OPTION): For frames smaller
*     than 64 bytes, padding will be included in the hardware calculated
*     checksum.
*     software must subtract out this data. It may be better to allow the
*     TCP/IP stack verify checksums for this type of packet.
*
*   - VLAN enabled (XXGE_VLAN_OPTION): The 4 extra bytes in the Ethernet header
*     affect the hardware calculated checksum. software must subtract out the
*     1st two 16-bit words starting at the 15th byte.
*
* <h3>Transmit Checksum Offloading</h3>
*
* For transmit, the software can specify where in the frame the checksum
* calculation is to start, where the result should be inserted, and a seed
* value. The checksum is calculated from the start point through the end of
* frame.
*
* The checksum offloading settings are sent in the transmit AXI4 Stream control
* words. The relevant control word fields are described in brief below.
* Refer to the XGEMAC Ethernet hardware specification for more details.
*
*<h4>AXI4-Stream Control Word 0:</h4>
*<pre>
*	Bits  1-0  : Transmit Checksum Enable: 	01 - partial checsum offload,
*						10 - full checksum offload
*						00 - No checksum offloading
*						11 - Not used, reserved
*	Bits 27-2  : Reserved
*	Bits 31-28 : Used for AXI4-Stream Control Mode flag
*</pre>
*
*<h4>AXI4-Stream Control Word 1:</h4>
*<pre>
*	Bits 31-16 (MSB): Transmit Checksum Calculation Starting Point: Offset
*			  in the frame where checksum calculation should begin
*	Bits 15-0  (LSB): Transmit Checksum Insertion Point: Frame offset where
*			  the computed checksum value is stored, which should be
*			  in the TCP or UDP header
*   </pre>
*
*<h4>AXI4-Stream Control Word 2:</h4>
*<pre>
*	Bits 31-16 (MSB): Reserved
*	Bits  0-15 (LSB): Transmit Checksum Calculation Initial Value: Checksum
*			  seed value
*</pre>
*
* <h3>Receive Checksum Offloading</h3>
*
* For Receive, the 15th byte to end of frame is check summed. This range of
* bytes is the entire Ethernet payload (for non-VLAN frames).
*
* The checksum offloading information is sent in the receive AXI4-Stream
* Control words. There are 4 relevant control words available. However
* only the relevant control words are described in brief below.
* Refer to the XGEMAC Ethernet hardware specification for more details.
*
*<h4>AXI4-Stream Control Word 0:</h4>
*<pre>
*	Bits 31-28 (MSB): Always 0x5 to represent receive status frame
*	Bits 27-16	: Undefined
*	Bits 15-0  (LSB): MCAST_ADR_U. Upper 16 bits of the multicast
*			  destination address of the frame.
*
*<h4>AXI4-Stream Control Word 1:</h4>
*</pre>
*	Bits 31-0	: MCAST_ADR_L. The lower 32 bits of the multicast
*			  destination address.
*
*<h4>AXI4-Stream Control Word 2:</h4>
*Various status information on the received packet.
*
*<h4>AXI4-Stream Control Word 3:</h4>
*	Bits 31-16	: T_L_TPID. This is the value of 13th and 14th byte
*			  of the frame.
*	Bits 15-0 	: Receive Raw Checksum: Computed checksum value
*
*<h4>AXI4-Stream Control Word 3:</h4>
*	Bits 31-16	: VLAN_TAG. Value of 15th and 16th byte of the
*			 frame.
*	Bits 15-0 	: RX_BYTECNT. Received frame length.
*
*
* <h2>Extended multicast</h2>
* (XXGE_EXT_MULTICAST_OPTION): Allow and perform address filtering more than 4
* multicast addresses. Hardware requires to enable promiscuous mode
* (XXGE_PROMISCUOUS_OPTION) and disable legacy multicast mode
* (XXGE_MULTICAST_OPTION) for this feature to work.
*
* <h2>Extended VLAN</h2>
*
* <h3>TX/RX VLAN stripping</h3>
* (XXGE_EXT_[T|R]XVLAN_STRP_OPTION) handles transmit/receive one VLAN tag
* stripping in Ethernet frames. To enable this option, hardware requires to
* build with this feature and enable (XXGE_FCS_INSERT_OPTION),
* (XXGE_FCS_STRP_OPTION) and disable (XXGE_VLAN_OPTION). Supports three modes,
* -XXGE_VSTRP_NONE   : no stripping
* -XXGE_VSTRP_ALL    : strip one tag from all frames
* -XXGE_VSTRP_SELECT : strip one tag from selected frames
*
* <h3>TX/RX VLAN translation</h3>
* (XATE_EXT_[T|R]XVLAN_TRAN_OPTION) handles transmit/receive one VLAN tag
* translation in Ethernet frames. To enable this option, hardware requires to
* build with this feature and enable (XATE_FCS_INSERT_OPTION),
* (XXGE_FCS_STRP_OPTION), and disable (XXGE_VLAN_OPTION).
*
* <h3>TX/RX VLAN tagging</h3>
* (XXGE_EXT_[T|R]XVLAN_TAG_OPTION) adds transmit/receive one VLAN tag in
* Ethernet frames. To enable this option, hardware requires to build with this
* feature and enable (XXGE_FCS_INSERT_OPTION), (XXGE_FCS_STRP_OPTION),
* (XXGE_JUMBO_OPTION) and disable (XXGE_VLAN_OPTION). Support four modes,
* -XXGE_VTAG_NONE    : no tagging
* -XXGE_VTAG_ALL     : tag all frames
* -XXGE_VTAG_EXISTED : tag already tagged frames
* -XXGE_VTAG_SELECT  : tag selected already tagged frames
*
* <h2>PHY Communication</h2>
*
* Prior to PHY access, the MDIO clock must be setup. This driver will set a
* safe default that should work with AXI4-Lite bus speeds of up to 150 MHz
* and keep the MDIO clock below 2.5 MHz. If the user wishes faster access to
* the PHY then the clock divisor can be set to a different value (see
* XXgEthernet_PhySetMdioDivisor()).
*
* MII register access is performed through the functions XXgEthernet_PhyRead()
* and XXgEthernet_PhyWrite().
*
* <h2>Link Sync</h2>
*
* When the device is used in a multi speed environment, the link speed must be
* explicitly set using XXgEthernet_SetOperatingSpeed() and must match the
* speed PHY has negotiated. If the speeds are mismatched, then the MAC will not
* pass traffic.
*
* The application/OS software may use the AutoNegotiation interrupt to be
* notified when the PHY has completed auto-negotiation.
*
* <h2>Asserts</h2>
*
* Asserts are used within all Xilinx drivers to enforce constraints on argument
* values. Asserts can be turned off on a system-wide basis by defining, at
* compile time, the NDEBUG identifier. By default, asserts are turned on and it
* is recommended that users leave asserts on during development. For deployment
* use -DNDEBUG compiler switch to remove assert code.
*
* <h2>Driver Errata</h2>
*
*   - A dropped receive frame indication may be reported by the driver after
*     calling XXgEthernet_Stop() followed by XXgEthernet_Start(). This can
*     occur if a frame is arriving when stop is called.
*   - On Rx with checksum offloading enabled and FCS/PAD stripping disabled,
*     FCS and PAD data will be included in the checksum result.
*   - On Tx with checksum offloading enabled and auto FCS insertion disabled,
*     the user calculated FCS will be included in the checksum result.
*
* @note
*
* Xilinx drivers are typically composed of two components, one is the driver
* and the other is the adapter.  The driver is independent of OS and processor
* and is intended to be highly portable.  The adapter is OS-specific and
* facilitates communication between the driver and an OS.
* <br><br>
* This driver is intended to be RTOS and processor independent. Any needs for
* dynamic memory management, threads or thread mutual exclusion, or cache
* control must be satisfied by the layer above this driver.
